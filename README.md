# Company E-commerce

## Description

### What is project about?

The project is an E-commerce Web App. This project contains both the customer side and a seller side too. You can be a customer to buy things as well as a seller to sell products. The front of the E-commerce i.e. customers, you buy the products from the world of Fashion, Beauty, Electronics and Furniture/Home Decor. The seller side contains an admin panel where you can do CRUD of Products, CRUD of discounts, and can edit seller info and company's info. This project is built on React with typescript. I have used libraries like redux-toolkit, tailwindcss, slick-carousel, tinymce for adding description, uui and axios.
